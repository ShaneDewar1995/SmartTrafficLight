# Smart Traffic Light System

Traffic control is becoming an increasing challenge all over the world, especially in densely populated cities where traffic congestion is an everday problem. The aim of this project was to design a traffic light system which models the timing sequence of a traffic light with 3 LED`s: red, yellow and green. The current timing sequence of the traffic lights are displayed on a set of multiplexed seven segment displays.
The system includes infrared receivers which detect when an emergency vehicle is approaching the intersection. The timing sequence is then automatically adjusted to allow safe passage through the intersection  for the emergency vehicle.


# Implementation

The System was implemented on a PIC16F690 micro controller. The diagram below shows the hardware setup. The source code is installed on the pic using a PIC KIT 3 programmer.
